Blue Team Print Your Own

For a full game set print the event cards once and the control cards twice - one set of controls for each player. 

In addition to the cards you will also need two sets of counters. One set of 20 to represent value (V) and another set of about 25 to represent levels. An alternative to individual physical counters may be to use common game dice to show how many levels each control has and how much value each player has.
