The Card Game That Teaches Information Security Threat and Defense

The Project
Information Technology Security is usually treated like a confusing maze of concepts which are often seen as an afterthought. While maturity models, best practices, and risk analysis processes have been developed as a means of making information decisions within the field there is often little in the way of outreach to other departments. Networking teams continue to create insecure connections, developers continue to write insecure code, and management continues to see I.T. Security as a necessary burden and not a partner towards the mission of their organization.

The goal of this game is to create a training tool to help bride this gap: to make the teaching of information security concepts understandable but enjoyable in a way that will help make these lessons memorable.

The game has three objectives:

Use real world examples of the components of risk to educate the players.
Use game mechanisms to reflect the elements of Information Security Security risk analysis process.
Make the experience fun and enjoyable to increase retention of that knowledge.

The Card Game
As CISO you are responsible for the decisions which protect your company from security events, but competition is fierce with your rival. You might not be able to hack them directly, but you can make it difficult for them in other ways...

#infosec is a two player card game of information technology security that focuses on threat modeling and defense. The goal is to prevent the loss of value - money, reputation, skill, or time - so that your company can stand above your competitor while staying one step ahead of hackers, vulnerabilities, and risk events.

The game is made of a deck of events, a deck of controls, value counters, and level counters. Security controls which are used to defend against risk events. Each control can be matured through investment of value and has abilities that give you an in-game strategic advantage.

Blue Team currently only exists in a print your own cards format. A ready-made version that can be purchased online will be made available soon.
